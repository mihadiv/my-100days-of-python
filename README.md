# 🐍 100 Days of Python - Inspired Projects

This repository contains my own projects **inspired by** the course  
[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

⚠️ Note: These are **not the original projects from the course**.  
Instead, I recreated and adapted the ideas with my own twists and different themes.  
This helps me practice Python concepts and improve my coding skills.
