# 🐍 100 Days of Python - Inspired Projects

This repository contains my own projects **inspired by** the course  
[100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/).

⚠️ Note: These are **not the original projects from the course**.  
Instead, I recreated and adapted the ideas with my own twists and different themes.  
This helps me practice Python concepts and improve my coding skills.

  <summary>Day 5 → SecurePass Generator</summary>
<br>

**Description:**  
A simple password generator that creates secure passwords based on user preferences, including length, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. The program also evaluates the generated password's strength (Easy, Medium, Strong) based on the types of characters used.

**How it works:**

- User inputs the desired password length.
- User chooses whether to include uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
- The program builds a character set based on these choices.
- A random password is generated from the selected characters.
- Password strength is determined:
  - Only lowercase letters → Easy
  - Lowercase + one other type (uppercase, numbers, or symbols) → Medium
  - Lowercase + two or more other types → Strong
- Optionally, the user can generate a second version by shuffling the original password.

**Example output:**  
Welcome to the SecurePass Generator!

How long should your password be? 12  
Include uppercase letters? (y/n) y  
Include numbers? (y/n) y  
Include symbols? (y/n) y  

Your secure password is: Ab4$kP9!qLm2  
Password strength: Strong

Generate a second shuffled version? (y/n): y  
Shuffled version: L2$q9bAm4!Pk
